Just to keep track of features added and to be added.

DONE:
- Send json request to create simple xls file
- Add Cell formats (colors,fonts,dates,bold etc)
- Add conditional formatting (highlight all cells in column A that have value < 50
- Resize columns
- Add merge cells
- Add conditional formatting
- Add realistic/more complicated examples & refactor/clean the examples code
- Optional tornado server
- Add documentation
- Add examples how to use

TODO:
- Easy:
    - Create clients for other programming languages
    - Return xls file to the client, or url to the xls file (user can choose)
    - Add Support for multiple cells to apply on a format to reduce server traffic. e.g rows 1-10 column 2 add specific format.
        Instead of sending redundant data.
    - Add Example 5 -> divide and conquer create xls in 4 steps.

- More Challenging:
    - Add Worksheet Tables

IN PROGRESS:
    - Add charts estimate start date jul 15th

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Some functionality works for columns A-Z only estimate start date jul 14th
- The tarball in /dist doesnt contains the exmaples/locations file therefore example4 wont work for the dist tarball
