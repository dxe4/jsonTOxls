Just to keep track of features added and to be added.

DONE:
- Send json request to create simple xls file
- Add Cell formats (colors,fonts,dates,bold etc)
- Add conditional formatting (highlight all cells in column A that have value < 50
- Resize columns
- Add merge cells
- Add conditional formatting
- Add realistic/more complicated examples & refactor/clean the examples code

TODO:
- Easy:
    - Add tutorials how to use
    - Create clients for other programming languages
    - Return xls file to the client, or url to the xls file (user can choose)
    - Add Support for multiple cells to apply on a format to reduce server traffic. e.g rows 1-10 column 2 add specific format.
        Instead of sending redundant data.

- More Challenging:
    - Add charts
    - Add Worksheet Tables

IN PROGRESS:
