Create Excel files using json requests. A tornado server (http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) that accepts json requests to create xls,xlsx files using XlsxWriter (https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter).

Documentation
------------

    I am planning for documentation in http://www.readthedocs.org but for now
    you can see the examples in client/examples/exmaple_functions.py and exmaple1-4.xlsâ€Ž

    For input documentation used to create files you can check xlsxwritter documentation at:
    https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

    Note: See client/exmaples/example4.xls and client/examples/example4.json for a realistic example,
    It contains lot of data, conditional formatting, fonts, colors, mergin etc
